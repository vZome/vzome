# TypeScript migration

**Phase 1 (legacy transpiled code): COMPLETE.**  **Phase 2 (the rest of `online/`): started —
the worker ↔ client protocol is done and merged (PR #1147); see *Suggested order* for what is next.**

---

## Phase 1 — the legacy code (done)

The generated TypeScript under `online/src/worker/legacy/from-java/` is now the source of truth
for online vZome, edited directly.  JSweet, the monolithic bundles, and the Java build for
`online/` have all been removed.

This file previously held a *plan*.  It is kept as a record of what was actually done,
because the outcome differs from the plan in ways worth knowing.

### What the plan got wrong

The plan proposed a two-phase approach: first make the code compile as-is with
`"module": "None"` plus `outFile`, then migrate to ES modules incrementally.  Phase 1 was
implemented and verified, then **deliberately discarded**: it produces a green `tsc` but no
bundling benefit at all, since `outFile` just reproduces the monolith and every entry point
still pays for the whole 2.9MB.

Three other assumptions turned out to be false:

- *"The j4ts types aren't declared anywhere in `.d.ts` form"* — they were.  `j4ts.d.ts`
  already existed in the `vorth/j4ts` fork; only the runtime `bundle.js` had ever been
  copied into this repo.  Vendoring the existing file, with one edit making
  `Iterable.forEach` / `Iterator.forEachRemaining` optional, fixed 11 of the 27 errors on
  its own.  No hand-written declarations were needed.
- *"If you add even one `import` or `export`, TypeScript re-interprets the file as a
  module, breaking all the cross-namespace references"* — true in isolation, but not an
  obstacle: converting **every** file at once, with a codemod that rewrote each
  cross-namespace reference into an import, avoids the mixed state entirely.
- The plan assumed nested namespaces were the thing preventing compilation.  They were
  not.  Both the monolith and the per-class tree compiled to exactly the same 27 errors
  under `"module": "none"`; those 27 were ordinary type errors, the same ones JSweet had
  always reported.  Namespaces blocked *bundling*, not *compilation*.

### What was actually done

1. Vendored `j4ts.d.ts` alongside the runtime bundle, plus a `bundle.d.ts` re-exporting
   the ambient namespaces as module bindings, and a small `shims.d.ts` for three types
   j4ts lacks entirely.  Errors: 27 → 11.
2. Ran a one-time codemod, `online/scripts/ts-to-esm.mjs`, converting all 433 per-class
   files from namespaces to ES modules with explicit imports.  Errors: 11 → 0.
3. Rewired the hand-written consumers to import named classes instead of pulling in the
   whole `com` namespace object, which is what actually enables tree-shaking.
4. Deleted the monolithic `core-java.js` and `ts/core-java.ts`, the JSweet scripts and
   Gradle project, the `jsweet.yml` workflow, and `online/src/worker/java/`.

5. Split the exporters behind a dynamic `import()`, so they load only when an export is
   actually requested.

`dist/modules/vzome-legacy.js` — the chunk fetched to open a design — went from
**3,788,215 to 1,496,217 bytes (-60.5%)**.  The zomic interpreter (323KB) and the
exporters (127KB) are now separate chunks, fetched only when a design uses a Zomic script
or the user exports.

### Five bugs the migration exposed

Each was invisible while everything shared one global scope, or -- for the last two --
while nothing compared this code against the Java it came from:

- **Seven Java static initializers** were run by the monolith's epilogue and by nothing
  else.  `XmlSymmetryFormat` registers every `.vZome` format namespace there, so without
  it `getFormat()` returned null and *every* design failed to open.  The 106 lazy
  `_$LI$()` primes in the same epilogue turned out to be genuinely optional; the 7 are not.
- **`java.util.Properties` and `java.io.StringWriter`** are not part of the j4ts candy —
  vZome transpiles its own.  Hand-written JS reaching them through `java.*` worked only
  because the monolith merged both sources into one namespace.
- **Module cycles whose base class is in the cycle** are fatal in ESM
  (`Class extends value undefined`).  Only one existed: `AbstractCommand` referenced two
  of its own subclasses for three string constants.
- **`java.text.NumberFormat` was an empty stub**: the fraction-digit setters did nothing
  and `format()` was string concatenation, so twelve classes that ask for fixed precision
  silently got the full float.  Now implemented against real JDK behaviour and pinned by
  `yarn check:numberformat` against a 3278-case corpus captured from a JDK.
- **`goToEdit()` was passed the file's `editNumber`**, which counts edits as written in the
  file, while `goToEdit` indexes the internal history -- longer after an old-format file's
  edits are migrated.  One design with `editNumber="40"` has 248 internal edits, so it
  rewound ~208 edits' worth of work.  This one is notable for two reasons: it is a bug the
  migration *surfaced* rather than caused (it is present on `main` too), and it affects the
  live app, where the scene renders correctly from a snapshot but the model underneath is
  unwound, so the first undo or redo jumps.

### Validated against the Java, not just against itself

Phase 1 was declared done when `yarn typecheck` was green and the app ran.  It has since
been measured properly, using the POV-Ray regression tooling that arrived on `main`
(`scripts/run-batch-pov.mjs`, comparing against a golden tree generated by
`./gradlew core:batchPov`).  Exporting the same 112 regression designs through both paths
and comparing the geometry:

| | matches the Java golden |
|---|---|
| `main` | 73 / 112 (65%) |
| this branch, before the ports below | 0 / 112 (0%) |
| **this branch now** | **93 / 112 (83%)** |

Of the 39 designs `main` gets wrong, this branch fixes 20; there are **zero** designs
`main` exports correctly and this branch does not.  Two independent JavaScript runs are
also now byte-identical, where the framework's notes recorded "0 of 60 sampled designs
exported reproducibly".

The 0% row is worth reading carefully: it is not `main`'s score, it is *this branch with
four fixes missing*.  The migration deleted `core-java.js`, which silently carried four
POV-Ray fixes; `PORT-NOTES.md` recorded them, and they were reimplemented against the
`from-java` tree.  That is the concrete cost of the "nothing regenerates these trees any
more" hazard, and the reason the mirroring rule in `AGENTS.md` matters.

The remaining 19 are genuine open work, not migration damage: shape-geometry differences
(one mesh has 34 triangles in Java, 24 here), the large-integer precision defect, designs
whose shape resources are not shipped to the web, and four hard failures.

### Where to look now

- `online/src/worker/legacy/from-java/README.md` — what to know before editing the tree
- `AGENTS.md`, *Coding Conventions* — the Java ↔ TypeScript mirroring rule, which is now
  the load-bearing process constraint
- `online/src/worker/legacy/PORT-NOTES.md` — the four fixes the migration dropped, and how
  to verify a port with the batch POV tooling

---

## Phase 2 — the rest of `online/` (proposed)

Phase 1 made TypeScript *possible* in this project.  Phase 2 is about making it *useful*
for the code we actually write by hand.  It should be gradual and opportunistic: there is
no deadline, no big-bang rewrite, and no value in converting files just to raise a
percentage.

### The surface we are talking about

Excluding the legacy tree, `online/src` holds ~176 JS/JSX files and ~60K lines, but most
of that bulk is generated or vendored — the j4ts bundle (31K lines), the ANTLR-generated
Zomic parser (~3.4K), `VRMLLoader.js` (~3K), and a generated CSS module.  **The
hand-written surface is ~169 files and ~22K lines**, which is a very tractable target.

### It already works — no build changes required

This was verified, not assumed:

- **esbuild transpiles `.ts` natively**, and `scripts/esbuild-solid-plugin.mjs` already
  matches `/\.(t|j)sx$/` and already loads `@babel/preset-typescript`.  A `.tsx` Solid
  component compiles through the real production config today.
- Renaming a file `.js` → `.ts` therefore needs **no config edit at all**.  98% of
  JS-module relative imports here already carry an explicit `.js` specifier (586 of 598),
  and TypeScript resolves a `.js` specifier to the `.ts` source, so *importers do not
  change when a file is renamed*.  That is what makes this safely incremental.  Only a
  dozen extensionless imports exist (e.g. `./drag`, `../fields/common`); they resolve
  fine either way, but are worth normalising when touched.

Two gaps to close before starting, both since closed by the tsconfig split (PR #1147):

1. `include` currently covers only `src/worker/legacy/from-java/**`.  New `.ts` outside that tree
   would compile via esbuild but never be typechecked — the worst of both worlds.  Add the
   rest of `src/`.
2. `jsx` is not set.  SolidJS needs `"jsx": "preserve"` with `"jsxImportSource": "solid-js"`
   for `.tsx` to typecheck (solid-js ships its own JSX types).

**Keep the legacy tree and new code at different strictness.**  The 433 transpiled modules
pass only under `strict: false`; flipping `strict: true` on them yields **4,216 errors**
(measured).  Chasing those is not worth it — they are machine output we mirror by hand, and
the errors are overwhelmingly JSweet's `any`-heavy calling conventions rather than real
defects.  New code deserves `strict: true`.  Use a second config
(`tsconfig.app.json`) with its own `include` and stricter options, and have `yarn typecheck`
run both, rather than dragging everything down to the legacy baseline.

### Third-party types

Mostly already good: `solid-js`, `solid-three`, `three-stdlib`, `@thisbeyond/solid-dnd`,
`txml`, `antlr4`, and `chevrotain` all ship declarations.

**`three` (0.184) ships none** — it has no `types` entry and no `.d.ts` in the package.
The viewer is the area that would benefit most from typing *and* the area that leans
hardest on three.js, so `@types/three` (version-matched) is a prerequisite for that work,
not an afterthought.

### Where the value actually is

Ranked by payoff, not by size.  The ordering reflects one idea: **types are worth most
where a contract crosses a boundary that the runtime does not check.**

#### 1. The worker ↔ client message protocol — DONE (merged, PR #1147)

*Kept here because the reasoning still explains why it was worth doing, and because what
it turned up changes the estimates for what is left.*

Everything crosses `postMessage`, so it is structurally unchecked: a renamed field or a
wrong payload shape produces no error anywhere — it just silently does nothing.
`worker-client-scene-protocol.md` records those failures costing "significant time to track
down because they fail *silently* (no console error, no thrown exception, just wrong or
missing rendering)."

What shipped:

- `viewer/protocol.ts` — `WorkerAction` (22 inbound) and `WorkerEvent` (22 outbound) as
  discriminated unions, plus the `postMessage` envelope and `ActionOf<T>` / `EventOf<T>`.
- `viewer/util/actions.js` → `.ts`, 19 creators typed.  No importer changed: all seven
  already used `.js` specifiers, which tsc and esbuild both resolve to the `.ts` source.
- `worker/client-events.ts` — `clientEvents` extracted from `vzome-worker-static.js` and
  its 14 senders typed.
- All 14 open-coded `ALERT_RAISED` sends routed through `errorReported`.

Four things the plan had wrong or did not know:

- **The receive side was already centralised too.**  The plan treated worker → client as an
  afterthought; in fact `clientEvents` was an exact structural twin of `workerAction`, 14
  named senders in 30 lines.  It was the cheaper *and* higher-value half, since that is the
  direction the silent-rendering bugs travel.
- **`isInspector` is a live compatibility contract, not dead code.**  An older React client,
  whose source no longer exists, sets it; the worker turns it into `payload.polygons` for
  every message type.  It is an envelope concern and has to keep working.
- **The 8 "inline" outbound sends were 31**, and 15 of them were `ALERT_RAISED` — a message
  that already had a sender.  That duplication had hidden a real defect: `PROPERTY_SET`'s
  catch block logged an out-of-scope `${action}`, so a failing `setProperty` threw a
  `ReferenceError` before its alert could send, and the user got a generic message instead
  of the property name.  Fixed.
- **Typechecking ran nowhere.**  esbuild strips types without checking them, and no build or
  dev path invoked `tsc`, so the strict project was a gate nobody walked through.
  `cicd/online.bash` now typechecks in `buildForProduction`, which is what CI runs.

The limit worth remembering: the callers are still `.jsx`, and `allowJs` is false, so their
*arguments* are not checked yet.  `editor.jsx` calling `selectSnapshot('wrong')` still
compiles.  Those files get hover and completion now; enforcement arrives as each is
converted.  A discriminated union pins the boundary only where both sides are typed.


#### 2. The scene records — shapes, instances, orientations

`worker/legacy/scenes.js` builds the objects the renderer consumes:

```js
{ id, position: [x,y,z], orientation, color, selected, shapeId, type, label }   // instance
{ id, name, vertices, faces }                                                    // shape
```

These flow worker → client alongside the protocol above, and `symmetry-geometry.jsx` /
`symmetry-renderer.js` destructure them extensively.  Typing these records is what makes
the renderer legible to an editor and to an LLM: today, `instance.` offers no completion
anywhere, and nothing catches a field that quietly stopped being emitted.

Note the trap here: `shapeId` (a random UUID, used by the scene protocol and the viewer's
instancing cache) and `shapeKey` (a content hash, used by the POV-Ray exporter to dedup
shapes) are different identifiers for different purposes.  Confusing them has already cost
real debugging time -- when `deriveGeometricKey` was collapsing every panel to one key, the
symptom looked like an exporter bug, but the same keys are the geometry cache keys.  A named type per identifier —
`type ShapeId = string & { __brand: 'ShapeId' }` — makes that class of mistake impossible
rather than merely documented.

#### 3. SolidJS context values

There are **11 context providers** (`scene.jsx` 347 lines, `camera.jsx` 321,
`editor.jsx` 306, `worker.jsx` 137, …), and the project's stated design philosophy is
*prefer context over props*.

That philosophy makes typing them unusually valuable: when data arrives via context rather
than props, **nothing at the consumption site says what is available**.  An LLM reading a
component sees `useCamera()` and has to go find the provider to learn the shape; an editor
offers no completion at all.  Typing the context value fixes both at once, and it is a
small, self-contained edit per provider — the value object is usually constructed in one
place.

Start with `worker.jsx` (it is the protocol's client edge, so it pairs naturally with #1),
then `scene.jsx` and `camera.jsx`.

#### 4. `worker/fields/common.js` and the field modules

384 lines implementing exact algebraic arithmetic, with a small, sharply-defined API
(`createNumberFromPairs`, `simplify`, …) consumed by `jsweet2js.js` across the
JS ↔ transpiled-Java boundary.  Small, pure, heavily reused, and semantically fussy —
`number[]` versus `bigint[]` versus "pairs" is exactly the confusion a type catches.
Good early win: high leverage, low risk, no UI involvement.

#### 5. Narrowing helpers for the `__interfaces` type tests

The transpiled code carries JSweet's runtime type-identity machinery: **467
`__class` and 247 `__interfaces` declarations**, tested at **334 call sites**.
Each test looks like this, open-coded:

```js
if ( man != null && man.constructor != null && man.constructor["__interfaces"] != null
     && man.constructor["__interfaces"].indexOf("com.vzome.core.model.Panel") >= 0 ) { ... }
```

Those 333 sites cover only **22 distinct interfaces**, and just six of them —
`Strut`, `Connector`, `Panel`, `Manifestation`, `AlgebraicNumber`,
`org.w3c.dom.Element` — account for **247**.  That concentration is what makes
this worth doing.

Roughly 65 of those sites are not type checks at all: they are JSweet's *overload
dispatch*, emulating Java method overloading with `foo( a?: any, b?: any )` plus
a runtime branch.  Replacing those means giving each overload a real signature,
which is a rewrite of the method rather than a swap of the check.  Leave them.

The other ~219 are genuine domain questions ("is this Manifestation a Strut?"),
and those have a clean idiomatic answer — a user-defined type predicate, which
narrows properly and was verified to typecheck against the real interfaces:

```ts
export const isStrut = ( m: Manifestation ): m is Strut =>
  typeof ( m as any ).getZoneVector === 'function';

if ( isStrut( m ) ) return m.getEnd();   // narrowed to Strut, fully typed
```

**But `instanceof` is not available, and pure structural probing is unsafe.**
Six hand-written JavaScript classes register themselves into the mechanism —
`JavaAlgebraicNumber`, `JavaAlgebraicNumberFactory`, `JavaDomElement`,
`JavaDomNodeList`, `JavaDomDocument`, and `OSField` in `core.js`.  None of them
`extend` anything from `from-java`; they satisfy the interfaces by shape plus the
tag, so `instanceof` returns false for all of them.

Worse, the shapes are only *partial*.  `JavaAlgebraicNumber` implements 19
methods against a 27-method interface — it has no `plus`, `minus`, `times`,
`negate`, `isZero` — and works only because nothing calls those on that
particular implementation.  A structural predicate probing the wrong method would
silently misclassify it.

So the tag is not merely a slow `instanceof`: it is a deliberate **nominal
assertion** that a partially-conforming object counts as the interface.  That is
real information TypeScript's structural typing cannot recover.

**Recommended approach — a narrowing layer, not a migration:**

1. Write predicates for the six hot interfaces, covering 247 of the 334 sites.
2. Implement each one *over the existing tag* at first:
   `m.constructor?.__interfaces?.includes( 'com.vzome.core.model.Strut' )`.
   Identical runtime behaviour, but one audited chokepoint instead of 334
   open-coded string comparisons, and callers get narrowing for free.
3. Convert call sites opportunistically.  `json.js` and
   `controllers/buildplane.js` are the natural first two: they are hand-written,
   and they already broke once.
4. **Leave the `__class` / `__interfaces` declarations in place permanently.**
   They cost nothing, they are what the predicates read, and they remain the ABI
   shared with hand-written JavaScript (see *What to leave alone*).

Removing the tags themselves would mean auditing whether each of those six
partial implementations genuinely satisfies its interface — much larger, much
riskier, and with no user-visible gain.

### What to leave alone

- **`worker/legacy/from-java/**`** — already TypeScript; do not tighten it (see above).
- **Generated and vendored files** — the ANTLR Zomic parser, `VRMLLoader.js`, the j4ts
  bundle, generated CSS.  Converting generated output is pure cost.
- **`jsweet2js.js` and `core.js`** — the hand-written bridge into the transpiled world.
  They are dense with `any`-shaped interop and JSweet calling conventions; typing them
  honestly would mean a lot of `any`, and typing them dishonestly would be worse than
  leaving them plain.  Revisit only after the protocol and scene types exist, since those
  are what would give the bridge something real to be typed *against*.
- **Leaf `.jsx` components** with simple props.  Converting them is easy, which is exactly
  why it is tempting — but the payoff is small and it burns the appetite for the work that
  matters.  Let these follow naturally when a file is being edited anyway.

### Suggested order

Steps 1-5 are done and merged (PR #1147): the tsconfig split, the protocol unions, the
typed action creators, the typed `clientEvents`, and the `ALERT_RAISED` consolidation.
The CI typecheck gate and the VS Code compiler pin went in alongside them.

**6. The seven remaining inline outbound sends.**  `FETCH_STARTED`, `TEXT_FETCHED`,
   `CONTROLLER_CREATED`, `WORKER_READY`, `SHARE_SUCCESS` / `SHARE_FAILURE`,
   `CAMERA_SNAPPED`, `BOM_CHANGED` are still built as object literals in
   `vzome-worker-static.js`.  Give each a `clientEvents` sender and migrate its call sites,
   as was done for `ALERT_RAISED`.  Note `TEXT_FETCHED` deliberately withholds `name` on
   some paths and sends it again once loading has succeeded — that is not an oversight to
   normalise away.

   **Constraint that governs this step:** `report` and `sendToClient` are not
   interchangeable.  A reply answering a `postRequest` must go through the
   `requestId`-stamping wrapper or the client's promise never resolves.  Preserve which
   sender each site uses; do not just swap the call.

7. `worker/vzome-worker-static.js` → `.ts`, so the receiving `switch` is checked against
   `WorkerAction`.  Larger (669 lines) and *not* purely mechanical: `onmessage` mutates
   `payload.polygons` before the `switch` narrows on `type`, which fights narrowing and
   wants restructuring first.  Doing step 6 first shrinks it.

8. **Scene record types** — instance, shape, orientation, plus branded `ShapeId` /
   `ShapeKey`.  The protocol deliberately left payload interiors as `unknown`; this is the
   step that fills them in.  A `.d.ts` is enough at first.

9. `worker/fields/common.js` → `.ts`.  Small, pure, high-reuse.

10. Narrowing predicates for `Strut` / `Connector` / `Panel` / `Manifestation`,
    implemented over the existing tag.  Pairs naturally with step 8.

11. `@types/three` (0.184.1 is version-matched), then `viewer/context/worker.jsx` and the
    other context providers.  This also unblocks `src/app/classic/tools/drag.ts`, which is
    already TypeScript but excluded from `tsconfig.app.json` because `three` ships no types.

12. Thereafter: opportunistic.  Convert a file when you are already editing it and the types
    would have helped.

**Not `checkJs`.**  Measured: turning it on across the hand-written surface yields **1,393
errors**.  About 491 are in generated files (the ANTLR Zomic parser), 179 are missing
third-party types, and the ~838 `TS2339`s are largely untyped context values — i.e. the
thing steps 8 and 11 exist to fix.  It becomes practical as a *result* of that work, not as
a shortcut past it.

### How to tell it is working

Not by counting converted files.  The signals worth watching:

- `yarn typecheck` catches a protocol mismatch **before** you reload the browser.
- An editor autocompletes `instance.` and `useCamera().` correctly.
- A renamed payload field produces a red squiggle at every call site instead of a silent
  no-op.

If a conversion does not move one of those, it was probably not worth doing yet.

A fourth signal, learned from Phase 1: some contracts are about *behaviour*, not shape, and
no type will pin them.  `NumberFormat` had a perfectly good type and still returned the
wrong string.  `yarn check:numberformat` catches that by asserting against a corpus captured
from a real JDK, and the batch POV comparison does the same for the exporters.  Where a
module's contract is "produce exactly what the Java produces", reach for a corpus rather
than a type.
