# This is a sample vZome.preferences file.
#
# If it is placed in your "user.home" directory, and named "vZome.preferences",
# it will control various aspects of vZome operation.  The older name of ".vZome.prefs"
# will still work.  If "vZome.preferences" is present, ".vZome.prefs" is ignored.
#
# On Mac OS X, the file should be placed in your ~/Library/Preferences/vZome folder. 
#  (Your home directory is denoted by "~" on Unix and Mac OS X.)
#
# If there is any question about where "user.home" is on your machine,
# you can look at the console output after running vZome... it reports where
# it looks for the file.
#
# The property values in this file match those used as the default
# values when you have no vZome.preferences file, or when you have not
# set one or more of these properties in your preferences file.
#
# The file uses standard java.util.Properties file syntax.

#

# When using the "import 4D VEF file..." command, the projection normally uses
# the usual red, yellow, blue, and green struts.  If this property is set to "true",
# the model will be rotated 90 degrees about some blue axis, so that purple, orange,
# and black struts will replace some or all of the yellow, red, and blue struts, respectively.
